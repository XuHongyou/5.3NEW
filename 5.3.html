     <h2>Hello.</h2>
     <p class="intro">I am a student studying IT. I am a sophomore studying at NBCC. I ❤️ anime, games and novels.</p>

       <h3>Design & Development</h3>
       <p>I started learning to code at the age of 19 because I wanted to make my own video games. Over time, I have gained 
          a wealth of experience in designing and developing mobile and web applications. I started learning to code after I 
          got into college because I felt it should be fun. After a year of study, I have mastered some basic programming 
          methods.</p>
<h3>Swim</h3>
       <p>My most useful skill is swimming. I got good grades in the sports swimming exam in middle school. And I think 
          swimming can save yourself in some cases</p>
